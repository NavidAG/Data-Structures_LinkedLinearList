# Data Structures: Linked Linear List
Let's have a quick review of what Liked Linear List is:
>Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. [-GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/)

As Always, we want to take this to next level. This Project is not a simple linked list.

## Doubly Linked Circular List With Head Node
* Doubly linked list
>A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list. [-GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/)

* Circular linked list
>Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list. [-GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/)

* Head Node
>A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.  [-GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/)
